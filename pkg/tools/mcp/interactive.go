// stack to refuse any flow that would require user input. The canonical
// example is OAuth: a remote MCP server's first contact is typically a 401
// Unauthorized that triggers an interactive elicitation flow ("approve OAuth
// authorization?"). During startup the TUI is not yet ready to surface that
// dialog, the user has no input field, and Ctrl-C cannot reach the elicitation
// goroutine because it is blocked on a synchronous send/receive.
//
// Callers that prepare data eagerly (sidebar tool counts, dry-runs, health
// checks) should wrap their context with this helper so toolset Start()
// returns a meaningful error immediately instead of hanging the process.
//
// Once a real user interaction is in progress (RunStream), the context
// should NOT carry this value so the user can complete OAuth normally.

// is a silent deferral pending an interactive context, while a decline is
// a deliberate user action. Callers MUST NOT immediately retry the OAuth
// flow on a decline — that would re-emit the dialog the user just
// dismissed, which is exactly the bug this sentinel exists to prevent.
//
// Typical handling is for the caller (e.g. the MCP catalog toolset) to
// remove the server from its active set so subsequent tool enumerations
// don't kick off a fresh OAuth flow. Re-enabling the server (e.g. via
// the catalog's enable meta-tool) is the natural way for the user to
